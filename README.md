Personal customized templates for LaTex and TeXmacs.

## LaTeX
1. Beamer ([rendered preview](https://github.com/demoslam/latex-texmacs-templates/blob/master/LaTeX/beamer_tpl.pdf))
 + colors for blocks (examples, ...)
 + footline customization

## TeXmacs
not available yet.
TeXmacs should be a good typing system, however, the development is slow and the crash of the current version makes me unable to typing  with it.
